# Americans United for Responsible Choices (AURC)

Welcome to my AP U.S. Government project about advertising a political candidate or interest group. I was selected to represent the Conservative Interest Group on Social Services. Specifically, I have to convey the government's foul waste of money by arguing that private institutions should act as primary benefactors for welfare programs.

The main goals include:
- Lower taxes on the public
- Funding private organizations
- Making fun of the federal government
